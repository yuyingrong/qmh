<title>Religious Excitement | Quakers &amp; Mental Health</title>


<h2>Causes of Mental Illness</h2>

<article>
  <h3>Religious Excitement</h3>
<p>Religious excitement – also known as also known as religious madness, religious melancholy, religious fervor, religious frenzy, and religious insanity – was a psychological diagnosis given to patients whose religious thought “involved the prolonged arousal of powerful emotions, especially fear or elation, accompanied by overly imaginative and obsessive chains of thought.”[1] The height of religious insanity peaked in the nineteenth century, potentially spurred in parallel by both evangelical revivalism and increasing spiritualism in the United States. However, its roots lay beyond that time, as Alexandra Prince states: “as early as 1621, Robert Burton described religion as a kind, cause and symptom of madness in his famous work “The Anatomy of Melancholy.” Anglican critics of Puritans dismissed them with the mad label religious melancholy. In eighteenth century England, Methodists and Quakers were labeled insane for their emotional worship style.”[2] </p>
<p>William Sims Brainbridge describes the causes of religious madness to include unresolved guilt, and intense religious experiences, stating “religion was a response rather than the cause of the problem.” [3] He believed the idea that as these causes were moral and not physical, those afflicted were curable, and therefore deserved humane treatment.[4] This aligns deeply with Friends Asylum, whose treatment for the majority of the nineteenth century was drawn from moral treatment, which sought to treat each patient humanely, not only with medicine, but community connection, religious involvement, and different kinds of occupational therapies. Bainbridge illuminates the possible conundrum of religious insanity, elucidating that many elements of nineteenth century mental illness are due to a lack of coping strategies. At the same time, “religion provides plans and interpretations for dealing with the most terrifying challenges of life.”[5] Therefore, treating the patient as a whole being, and not just treating their symptoms, would be the only way to fully resolve their illnesses.</p>
<p>With this also came the idea that mental illness was not seen as a moral or personal failure, but rather, in particular for religious insanity, part of being dedicated to one’s religion. Alice Mauger points out that it was in the late nineteenth century when asylum doctors were distinguishing between moral and physical causes of insanity – differentiating the moral or psychological causes “such as grief, bereavement, business or money anxieties, religion and ‘domestic trouble’ versus physical ailments.”[6] </p>
<p>At Friends Hospital, patients were admitted for a plethora of reasons. The alluvial graph on the “Types of Mental Illness” page[7] shows several examples of admission for religious insanity, such as religion, excitement, and excessive study. According to the main early admission book,[8] from 1836-1875, 25 people were admitted to Friends Hospital with religious excitement or religious anxiety. Of those, at discharge 23 were listed as restored or improved, with one person stationary, and unfortunately one who died only seven days after admission to the Hospital. This is likely only a portion of patients with religious insanity; others were admitted with other main diagnoses[HS1] , or their religious mania did not always present at admission. </p>
<p>While there was some concern that religious books might cause or exacerbate religious fervor, in their library for patients, Friends Hospital maintained a selection of Quaker books, hoping these would provide comfort to their patients.[9],[10] Interestingly, Quaker patients were allowed to attend the local Frankford Friends Meeting for weekly worship. Ruth Scott,[11] admitted in 1822 as incoherent and delusional, often had religious delusions. She regularly attended Frankford Meeting, though Superintendent Isaac Bonsall writes that she was not “in a suitable state of mind to go.”[12] At one point, charismatic Elias Hicks called a meeting at Frankford Friends Meeting. Bonsall refused to let Scott attend. Scott escaped from the Asylum and was halfway to the meetinghouse before she was caught.[13] Scott stayed at Friends Asylum for 18 months, at which point she was released, described as “much improved.” </p>
<p>In his 1841 “Observations on the religious delusions of insane persons […]” Nathaniel Bingham describes the differences between the diagnoses of religiously insane and insanely religious: for those who are religiously insane, religion is the cause of insanity, whereas for those who are insanely religious, they are “so far religious they are insane.”[14] He continues on to state that those in the latter category are able to be “cured” when relieved of their religious fervor. From the data presented on Friends Hospital patients, it can be surmised that the majority of these individuals with religious excitement fall into the latter category, being restored before they are released from the Hospital. </p>
